                    <h2>A funny story</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone! Have you ever traveled to a new country and found it surprisingly familiar? Well, let me share a funny story from my first trip to here.
                        <br />
                        <br />When I first arrived in Thailand, I was surprised at how similar everything seemed to China. The immigration officials greeted me in Chinese, many info signs were in Chinese, and even the salesperson for the SIM card spoke Chinese. Many shops accepted Alipay and WeChat. Everything felt so familiar!
                        <br />
                        <br />After getting through immigration, I called a taxi. The driver was very helpful, even assisting me with my luggage. Feeling comfortable and confident, I opened the door and got into the car as I normally would back home.
                        <br />
                        <br />Suddenly, the driver looked at me in amazement and shouted, "Do you want to drive the car?"
                        <br />
                        <br />I had forgotten that in Thailand, they drive on the left side of the road! We both laughed, and I quickly moved to the correct side. It was a funny start to my adventure in Thailand!

                    <h2>Living outside the box</h2>
                    <p>What would you choose: to follow tried-and-true methods within familiar boundaries or to explore new and unconventional paths, even if it means stepping outside your comfort zone?
                        <br />
                        <br />Dear fellow Toastmasters and future Toastmasters, good evening.
                        <br />
                        <br />Most people around me prefer a stable life and avoid change. But for me, stability isn’t enough—I like to live outside the box.
                        <br />
                        <br />I was born into a traditional family where dedication and stability are highly valued. My parents have worked for the same company for over 20 years and have never lived outside our hometown for more than a month. But I’m different from them. Staying in one place isn’t enough for me. As the only child in my family, I don't have any siblings to follow. So, I had the freedom to choose my own path in life. I decided early on to live outside the box by growing up, studying, and working in different countries.
                        <br />
                        <br />After finishing university, I wanted to see the world from a different angle, so I decided to continue my studies overseas instead of staying in my hometown. Living in another country, I experienced different cultures and learned to appreciate the diverse lives of the people around me.
                        <br />
                        <br />But life threw some challenges my way. Unfortunately, I spent the COVID year alone in Europe, stuck in the small town where my university was. It was a tough time—without socializing or traveling, I felt depressed and bored. So, I decided to break out of that box and move to a coastal city. I rented a house with a big window facing the beach. The endless sea brought me peace and new energy. I became more confident and found a job easily after graduation.
                        <br />
                        <br />I returned to China and started working in a high-paying, prestigious job at one of the largest banks in the country. But there was a downside—the 9 to 5 schedule, filled with endless meetings, made me feel that my life was stuck in a repetitive cycle. While others around me followed the same routine, I asked myself if this was the life I wanted. I chose to step out of that box again and moved to Thailand to try something new. My current hybrid work setup has given me more time to focus on myself.
                        <br />
                        <br />I love exploring the world outside the box. Each new experience brings fresh energy and opportunities. In the future, I will keep searching for better life experiences outside my current box. What about you?
                        <br />
                        <br />If you had the chance, would you choose to live outside the box and create your own impactable path?

                    <h2>A Chance to Change</h2>
                    <p> Good evening, fellow Toastmasters and distinguished guests,
                        <br />
                        <br />How many of you want to make the world a better place? And how many of you have heard the term 'SDGs,' or Sustainable Development Goals?
                        <br />
                        <br />For those who may not know, SDGs are 17 global goals set by the United Nations in 2015 to improve the world by 2030. They include targets like ending poverty and hunger, promoting gender equality, and ensuring clean water and sanitation for all, etc. Think of them as a to-do list for a better world.
                        <br />
                        <br />As a data analyst focused on SDGs, I look into the datasets that reveal sustainable development progress in Asia-Pacific countries. Earlier this year, my team discovered that our region is not on track to achieve all 17 SDGs by 2062, marking a significant 32-year delay.
                        <br />
                        <br />I am always thinking about how I could make a meaningful difference to the world in my field, and now I have that chance. In my current role, I need to share my analysis results and findings with stakeholders and the public, and help countries in assessing their progress towards SDGs.                     
                        <br />
                        <br />Two months ago, I faced an exciting challenge: training National Statistical Office (NSO) staff from several Asia-Pacific countries to use R for statistical analysis. It was my first time conducting such training for government officers from diverse backgrounds. I prepared for it a lot and spent many late nights tune-fine slides, scripting speeches, and organizing coding materials, driven by the exciting outcomes.
                        <br />
                        <br />During those intense training sessions, I had the privilege of collaborating with exceptional trainers. These mentors had strong technical skills and a great ability to engage and inspire the audience. Some were experienced professionals with many years of practice, showing a passion for data and innovation. Others brought new ideas, using creative ways to make complex concepts easy to understand.
                        <br />
                        <br />Together, we made a space where learning and ideas were shared openly. The impact was profound: NSO staff left empowered and eager to apply their newfound skills to shape evidence-based policies that can improve lives across their countries.
                        <br />
                        <br />Reflecting on these experiences, I am inspired by the excellent trainers I worked with, and reminded of the transformative power of effective communication and education.  It’s not just about conveying information—it's about igniting change. Equipping NSO staff with effective data analysis tools transforms them into advocates for SDGs, addressing critical issues like poverty, equality, and environmental sustainability. 
                        <br />
                        <br />However, I realized that analyzing data alone isn't enough. Effectively communicating insights is crucial to inspire action. Recognizing this, I feel a strong willingness to enhance my communication skills. By participating in Toastmasters, I hope to take the chance to change myself, improve myself, and become a better communicator. This will help me convey complex insights clearly, I can better advocate for SDGs and drive impactful policies through better collaboration with government officers and, ultimately, find a chance to change the world in my own way.
                        <br />
                        <br />In conclusion, I am honored to be part of this Club and dedicated to continuous learning and growth. Thank you.
